# Windows-Notepad
Fan-made Microsoft Windows Notepad (Java edition)

Windows Notepad is one of the oldest Windows softwares in history. Its initial release was back in 1983, 38 years ago.
For sure, it is an useful tool to edit source files. I have no complaints about that.
Its features and capabilities, however, needs several improvements to make it more powerful.
Here are some tweaks that I made to it.

-  It is cross-platform. As long as you have Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, it runs on Mac and Linux as well.
-  It is available in dark mode since many operating systems have it today.
-  It has some useful features that are requested by users.
-  It still has the familiar look as the original one.

Note that this is still in Beta stage. There will be some bugs.
Currently I am making it more platform-independent. I don't want it to look weird in other operating systems.
Hope you enjoy having fun with it!
